# Math_Test

This was an assignment for my CISC 124 class at Queen's University during the winter term of 2016
The assignment was to write a math test program using Java's Swing.
This program asks 21 questions testing the user on their Multiplication Table from 6 to 11.

This program has 3 different types of tests.
A Typed test where the user is asked a question and types in the correct answer.
A Multiple choice test where the user is given a question and 4 possible answers. The user must select the correct answer.
A Matching question, Where all 21 questions are displayer on the left, and all 21 answers and displayed on the right. The User must match the questions on the left to the correct answers on the right.
